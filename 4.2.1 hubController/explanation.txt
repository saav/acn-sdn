4.2.1 Hub Controller

a)
It takes an average of 29.368ms to ping. 
There is traffic on every host and switch, for each switch there is traffic on every port of the switch. 

b)
It takes an average of 34.855ms to ping. 
There is around a 5ms difference, which is not a magnitude of difference. 

c)
mininet> pingall
*** Ping: testing ping reachability
h1 -> h2 h3 h4 h5
h2 -> h1 h3 h4 h5
h3 -> h1 h2 h4 h5
h4 -> h1 h2 h3 h5
h5 -> h1 h2 h3 h4
*** Results: 0% dropped (20/20 received)

All hosts are reachable from any other host. 

d)
Between hosts h1 and h2
Results: ['15.8 Mbits/sec', '18.0 Mbits/sec']

Between hosts h1 and h5
Results: ['7.90 Mbits/sec', '8.38 Mbits/sec']

Therefore we can see that having more switches in between the hosts reduces throughput.
